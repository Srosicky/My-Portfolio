# Forest Fire Spread Simulation

This program simulated the spread of forest fire depending on forest density.

## Language(s)

Python

## Description

This project simulates the spread of a fire through a forest, represented as a 2D grid, to analyze how forest density affects the probability of fire spread. The forest consists of cells, where each cell can either be empty (0) or occupied by a tree (1). The fire starts at a specific row and spreads based on two search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

The project explores the dynamics of fire spread by using randomized forests of varying densities and uses statistical simulations to determine the likelihood of a fire reaching the bottom of the forest. It also visualizes the relationship between forest density and the probability of fire spread.

## Getting Started

This program can be run in any text editor that supports .py files using the Forest_Fire_Spread_Simulator.py file. The file itself contains implementations of DFS and BFS, but requires a Stack and Queue implementation (imported).
