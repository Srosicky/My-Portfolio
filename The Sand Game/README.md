# The Sand Game

Using the DUDraw library, this game allows the player to create sand, water, and ground and explore their interaction.

## Language(s)

Python

## Description

This Python program simulates a simple 2D particle-based environment where users can interactively place and observe the behavior of sand, water, and floor particles. Utilizing the dudraw library for visualization, the simulation mimics the basic physics of granular materials and fluids in a grid-based world.

The user can switch between different modes (sand, water, and floor) and draw particles directly onto the canvas. The particles then respond to gravity-like rules, with sand falling and settling, water flowing and spreading, and floor particles acting as solid barriers.

## Getting Started

This program can be run in any text editor that supports .py files using the Sand_Game.py file. The DUDraw library must be imported.

When playing:
- press s key for sand mode
- press w key for water mode
- press f key for floor mode
