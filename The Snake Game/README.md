# The Snake Game

The classic snake game! Give it a try!

## Language(s)

Python

## Description

This program is a recreation of the classic Snake Game, where the player controls a growing snake that navigates a grid-based field, consumes food, and avoids collisions with walls or itself. The game utilizes a Doubly Linked List implementation to efficiently manage the snake's body, enabling dynamic growth and smooth movement. The game leverages the dudraw library for real-time graphical rendering and user interaction.

## Getting Started

This program can be run in any text editor that supports .py files using the Sand_Game.py file. The DUDraw library must be imported and a Doubly Linked List implementation must be used.
